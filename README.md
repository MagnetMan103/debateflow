# Debate Flow App

## Usage

## About
I made this website after judging debate tournaments for a couple years and
realized it was very annoying to keep track of my flows. I also wanted a better
way to make flows and be able to transition to the aff/neg flow quickly. On the flow page,
I added a shortcut (shift + down arrow) that changes the side of the flow you are on
to make it possible to flow with just your keyboard.

Some features I still want to add include being able to share flows, being able to
collaborate on the same flow, and more settings for preferences in terms of text size,
or adding your own custom flow presets.

## Current Features
* Make a flow with an aff and neg side
* Store flows to look back on later
* Supporting British Parliamentary, Lincoln Douglas, and Public Forum flows
* Name flows to keep track of your roumds
